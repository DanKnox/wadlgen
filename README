=======

An experiment to try to generate WADL
(http://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl/) based on the routing information
found in Rails 3 config/routes.rb.

Approach:
- Minimal rake task that calls a library to generate the WADL
- Save application.wadl in public/
- Let the user edit application.wadl to add information that can't be 
  extracted, and preserve what the user has added the next time the
  task is run

Very work in progress.
