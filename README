wadlgen
=======

An experiment to try to generate WADL
(http://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl/) based on the routing information
found in Rails 3 config/routes.rb.

Approach:
- Minimal rake task that calls a library to generate the WADL
- Save application.wadl in public/
- Let the user edit application.wadl to add information that can't be 
  extracted, and preserve what the user has added the next time the
  task is run

What works:
- Parse a WADL file to an object model
- Generate a WADL file from an object model
- Parse a Rails Route file to a object model
- Rake task to parse the rails route

What remains
- merge two object models
- make the rails task write a public/application.wadl file
